# Light Grid

An animated theme for [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org). Light-cycles racing over a glossy neon grid, laying walls of light under a stormy sky.

## Install

```bash
omarchy theme install https://github.com/Gleasonmt/omarchy-light-grid-theme
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/Gleasonmt/omarchy-live-wallpaper --enable
```

Then pick **Light Grid** in Omarchy menu → Style → Theme. The first line is the theme
(colors, wallpaper, icons, keyboard lighting); the second makes the wallpaper move,
and also adds **Light Grid Lite** to the picker: the same picture with only small
parts moving, which uses the least power. Without the plugin you get the theme
with a still wallpaper.

Update with `omarchy theme update` and `omarchy plugin update`.

## How it moves

The wallpaper is a GPU shader (`live/1-the-grid.frag.qsb`, source in `src/`) drawn by the
[live-wallpaper plugin](https://github.com/Gleasonmt/omarchy-live-wallpaper);
`backgrounds/1-the-grid.png` is a frame of it, used by the lock screen and when the plugin
isn't installed. It pauses while a window covers the screen. See the plugin's README
for frame rates and battery settings.

Original artwork. The look is inspired by films and games; no logos or characters
are used.
